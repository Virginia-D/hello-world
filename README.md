Learning about git-hub

Hi! My name is Gin and I'm new to Github.  I have some programming experience from earning my BS in Math with a minor in Computer Science, teaching Computer Science to high school students, and (soon) being a graduate student studying software development.

I've spent most of the last 16 years teaching in secondary schools.  I'm looking to move out of public education and into a development position.

I've worked with Pascal, C, C++, Java, Alice, html, JavaScript, and SNAP!  While I only have a novice level of skill in most of these, I'm currently brushing up on my Java for the AP Computer Science A class I'm teaching and will be starting a class in Python in May.

If you have any advice on my programs, please let me know.  I'm here to learn and grow as a programmer.
